Todo:
Disconnected client results in a stuck window
NPCs do not 'turn' when clicked
Pet accessory info
Pet Evolve
Pet Change Accessory


Fix:
- Widgets reload their assets on Target Reset
- Panel lower boundings now properly draw
- Numeric Fields did not revert to '0' when empty, which caused issues with Getters
- Field/Dropdown did not fire change event before losing focus, (Character attributes did not seem to always update when clicking Apply)
- You can no longer jump to invalid coordinates by clicking quickly during map change
- Restructured NPC class as a derivative of Entity, and moved associated events into NPC class
- Sometimes clicking UI elements would result in the character walking/jumping

Feature:
- NPCs now display their nameplates on mouseover
- Pet Form:
- - You can change viewed pet by clicking the portrait.
- - Pet generations properly fills now.
- - You can change marching pets. Main UI gauges update accordingly.
- - You can drop pets that are not marching.
- - You can rename your pet


-------------------------------

Minor Bugs:
On Asset Reload, login form second field widget has a green hue, possible due to blend
Right click on map should always send a direction packet, even if its a npc click
packet 2031(npc action?) on right click as well?
