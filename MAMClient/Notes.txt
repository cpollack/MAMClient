Build notes 1.0.12

Major Fix:
- LARGE refactoring of monster and pet mechanics. Pet now inherits from Monster, which inherits from Entity. All share the same base with user/player classes for cleaner flows on animating and state handling.
- Battle and BattleScene classes restructured and cleaned up.

Fix:
- Faint animation in battle is smoother and doesn't leave extra frames
- If max mana changed, it did not update accordingly on the main window gauge
- Floating labels in battle no longer overlap, and were moved to the entity class

Enhancement:
- First pass 'catch-all' exception handling added to alert users of a thrown exception before shutting down the client semi-gracefully.
- 'BattleResponse' refactored to 'NormalAct' in battle. There are multiple battle action type reponses.
- Sprite rendering updated from frame counter to tick/ms based, allowing finer control of sprite animation.

Feature:
- Items can now be used in Battle. 
-- Items also cause a heal/poison effect when used
- Monster sprites in battle now apply the color packet for recoloring
- Players / Monsters visible on maps also apply the color shifts as appropriate



-------------------------------

Minor Bugs:
Right click on map should always send a direction packet, even if its a npc click
